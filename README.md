# Spectral Difference Calculator

This module provides functionality to calculate the difference between two spectral files.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Import the `SpectroscopicData` class from the `spectroscopic_data.py` module into your Python script:
   ```python
   from spectroscopic_data import SpectroscopicData
   ```

2. Create instances of `SpectroscopicData` for the two spectral files you want to compare:
   ```python
   data1 = SpectroscopicData(file_path1)
   data2 = SpectroscopicData(file_path2)
   ```

3. Calculate the difference between the two spectra using the `calculate_difference_spectrum` method:
   ```python
   difference_spectrum = data2 - data1
   ```

4. Further analysis or visualization can be performed on the `difference_spectrum` data.

## File Format

The spectral files should follow a specific format where each line represents a data point with the following columns:
1. Channel name
2. Wavelength
3. Reading

Example file format:
```
SE 200.000000 0.6599
SE 210.800000 0.6383
SE 220.600000 0.6205
...
```

## Additional Functionality

The `SpectroscopicData` class also provides additional methods for calculating average and root mean square (RMS) values for a given channel. These methods are described below:

- `calculate_average(channel_name)`: Calculates the average reading from all wavelengths for a given channel.

- `calculate_RMS(channel_name)`: Calculates the root mean square (RMS) of the reading from all wavelengths for a given channel.

- I will constantly update this module to include more functionality regarding parsing data files into multiple channels, extrating information from headers and dealing with exceptions, data analysis and visualization.
